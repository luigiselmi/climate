    "# Leave-one-out\n",
    "Leave-one-out is a a case of k-fold [cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#leave-one-out) technique to train a machine learning model. The k-fold technique splits the data into k separate folds or subsets where k-1 are used for training and one is used for validation. The procedure is repeated k times, every time changing the test set so that, after k training steps, all the data is used. With leave-one-out the number of folds is equal to the number of data points and the validation set is made up of one single data point at each train and validation step. Cross-validation and leave-one-out allow the best use of the data for training. Since it is computationally expensive it is used only with very small dataset. In this notebook we will create an ensemble of [Neural Network](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neural_networks_supervised.html) models (aka Multi Layer Perceptron), whose weights are randomly initialized, trained on a small dataset using the leave-one-out method. The final output of the ensemble model will be the mean value of the output of each member of the ensemble."
